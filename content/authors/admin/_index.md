PhD in Computational Finance from the University of Essex. I have built my careers in the academic finance area. My uniqueness is the interdisciplinary expertise that covers more than one area in analytics and data analysis application in investments. In this line, my research proposes the use of machine learning techniques to portfolio management. As a result, I have more than 20 peer-reviewed publications in this area. My publications can easily be viewed in the section Publications.

Currently, I am Lecturer in Econometrics and Investments in Postgraduate courses at the Instituto Tecnológico de Aeronáutica (Acronym ITA in Portuguese) in Brazil. I was contracted after a selection process for Lecturers in the areas of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science.

In 2021, I was awarded with the license for Investment Management by the Brazilian Securities and Exchange Commission (Acronym CVM in Portuguese) at the exclusive modality of "NOTORIOUS KNOWLEDGE". I am the first professional awarded with this license since 2018.
